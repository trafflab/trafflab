Benetton, an Italian clothing brand, became famous for its provocative advertising campaigns. One of the most controversial was "Unhate" in 2011, which depicted world leaders kissing each other on the lips—among them were U.S. President Barack Obama and China’s Hu Jintao. The campaign caused outrage, especially among political leaders, and was criticized for being too provocative.

How this applies to affiliate marketing

Affiliates can use emotionally charged and shocking visuals that make the audience stop and pay attention to the creative. Such elements can help your ad stand out among hundreds of others and increase CTR. However, it's crucial to consider cultural and political nuances to avoid crossing the line of what’s acceptable.

## 2. PETA: Shock for Animal Rights

PETA has repeatedly launched provocative campaigns that often shocked viewers. One such campaign featured nude celebrities with the slogan, "I'd rather go naked than wear fur." PETA frequently uses the tactic of emotional shock to draw attention to its cause.

How this applies to affiliate marketing

Using contrasts and unexpected elements can force users to notice your offer. Shocking headlines and images can create an emotional response, which in turn increases engagement. However, in affiliate marketing, it’s important to avoid content that could violate advertising platform rules.

## 3. Calvin Klein: The Brooke Shields Campaign

In 1980, Calvin Klein launched an ad campaign with 15-year-old Brooke Shields, who said, "You know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing." The campaign caused scandal due to its sexual undertones involving a teenager, but it also skyrocketed the brand’s popularity.

How this applies to affiliate marketing 

Using innuendo and intrigue can be a powerful tool for attracting attention. Affiliates can create creatives with mysterious or provocative messages that spark curiosity in users and compel them to click to learn more.

## 4. Burger King: "Moldy Whopper"

In 2020, Burger King launched the unusual "Moldy Whopper" campaign, showing a burger decaying over 34 days. The goal was to demonstrate that their products contain no preservatives. The campaign was unexpected and sparked many discussions, both positive and negative.

How this applies to affiliate marketing 

Creating creatives that defy expectations can elicit a strong response from the audience. In affiliate marketing, you can use unconventional images and copy that break stereotypes and encourage users to rethink their views on your product or offer.

## 5. Nike: "Dream Crazy" with Colin Kaepernick

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfToI_5_ClYhBdNZQ08FUy0YOT2s1oAEbM4vRmazhxY868DwAjomTdSRjYp90FiIpCAk55tYbROweAmWL8w_oUyshxjHSNsoAFrJrs3OnlfSm5ZD5HRlwxVjYapmCprLZEaJlza9TS2zJBagjqOMid8Rx4v?key=ULYGHZiGnGexf5cDCTlmlQ)

In 2018, Nike launched a campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick—the athlete who refused to stand for the U.S. national anthem in protest against racial injustice. The campaign sparked a strong reaction, dividing the audience into those who supported Kaepernick and those who opposed him. Despite the controversy, Nike saw a sharp increase in sales following the campaign.

How this applies to affiliate marketing 

Using current and socially significant themes can increase user engagement. It’s important to remember that such topics can polarize opinions, and this should be considered when creating creatives. Affiliates can adapt their campaigns to current trends and issues that resonate with users.

## 6. GoDaddy: Sexualized Images

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdiDUqWB8XcUE9lPhcHvkzoXTG_x0czvgNrUkQN6QJ-LBrgHqSs8EQgfqDW1R6FeLjdjPsBGu0PK9xXr5d-pzSDWJeGqzsIOYibvmRYBpGQG7YmfDvmmOIkKyiS9McYj8XIEDQykbQnmSatIMUCj2KsIrmd?key=ULYGHZiGnGexf5cDCTlmlQ)

GoDaddy long used sexualized imagery in its ad campaigns to attract attention. Their ads featuring scantily-clad models and innuendos sparked criticism for being overly sexual, but they worked, and the brand quickly gained online popularity.

How this applies to affiliate marketing

Sexual undertones can be a powerful tool for capturing attention, but in affiliate marketing, caution is needed. Many advertising networks have strict rules against overly explicit content, so it's important to strike a balance between provocation and adhering to platform standards.

## 7. Diesel: "Be Stupid"

Diesel's "Be Stupid" campaign in 2010 encouraged people to go against societal norms and take risks. The campaign's slogan was simple: "Stupid ideas make life interesting." It inspired freedom of action but was also criticized for promoting reckless behavior.

How this applies to affiliate marketing

Risky creatives that challenge traditions and stereotypes can capture the attention of a young audience, especially if your product is aimed at creative and unconventional users. Affiliates can use bold and unusual approaches to stand out from the competition.

## 8. Dove: "Real Beauty"

Dove's "Real Beauty" campaign, launched in 2004, sparked a huge response by showcasing everyday women with different body types, ages, and skin colors. This was a revolutionary step in the beauty industry, where unrealistic standards had long dominated.

How this applies to affiliate marketing

Honesty and authenticity can be powerful tools. In affiliate marketing, you can focus on showing products or services as they truly are. This builds trust in the brand and improves conversion rates.

## How Affiliates Can Apply These Principles

Using provocative or unconventional approaches in affiliate marketing can significantly increase engagement and draw attention to ad campaigns. Here are a few ways affiliates can apply the principles of controversial advertising campaigns:

1. Stand out from the competition

In the world of affiliate traffic, there are countless creatives competing for users’ attention. Using unconventional approaches, shocking or intriguing creatives can significantly boost CTR and help you stand out from competitors.

2. Leverage emotional triggers

Many controversial ad campaigns have successfully used emotions to elicit a response from the audience. Affiliates can focus on emotions such as joy, surprise, shock, or curiosity to keep users engaged.

3. Stay relevant 

It’s important to always stay updated on current events and use them to create creatives. Relevant topics and social trends can help you increase engagement and relevance in your campaigns.

4. Test boundaries

Don’t be afraid to experiment with creatives. Sometimes the line between a successful campaign and a failure is very thin, but it’s at this edge that the most effective advertising ideas can be born. The key is to maintain balance and adhere to advertising platform rules.

## Conclusion

Affiliate marketing is a game where the winner is the one who can attract and retain attention. Controversial advertising campaigns, like the ones we reviewed, are a great example of how boldness and out-of-the-box thinking can bring huge results. In affiliate marketing, provocative creatives and unconventional approaches can become powerful tools for achieving success.
