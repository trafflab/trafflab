Payment cards for advertising on international platforms are one of the key tools for affiliate marketers, and it's impossible to operate without them. The high demand for such cards is understandable, as is the wide range of services offering them. To help you navigate the variety of options when choosing a payment system, we've compiled some recommendations on what to consider and which services are best to partner with.

## What to Consider

No matter the size of your traffic — whether you work in a team or solo — there are a few universal criteria to keep in mind when selecting a service.

## Is the Service Active?

If you've come across a new service with attractive conditions, don't rush to make a decision and send money right away. We recommend contacting the service representatives first to clarify key details: card issuance terms, limits, and recommended BINs for your target region. This will not only provide useful information but also allow you to check how responsive the service is in fulfilling its commitments. If the company does not provide contact details, it raises the question: what are they hiding?

## Systematic Approach

Every service has its own conditions regarding minimum top-ups, card usage limits, and security: some require KYC verification, while others might ask for confirmation of personal accounts. These measures are not designed to complicate life for users but rather to ensure the security of funds and to guarantee that the service operates reliably and predictably. For example, Service X requires a minimum top-up of $100 for new users. While this may seem like a great opportunity to test the cards, there are some nuances. Small top-ups come with limitations, such as $1.75 decline fees and a limit of 5 cards. However, if you top up more than $500, these penalties are waived, and the available card limit increases to 100. Additionally, the full list of top-up methods is only available after successfully completing the KYC procedure. Choose services that operate in a systematic and transparent way.

## Customer Support

Determining the quality of customer support from the first interaction is not always easy, but it is one of the most important factors when choosing a payment service. Good support acts as a partner, aiming to make your experience as convenient and effective as possible. Unfortunately, some support services can leave much to be desired. If responses are limited to standard templates with no genuine interest in solving your issues, you should consider whether they will be able to meet your needs under the terms you require. A good support team should not only respond to requests but also be aware of market changes, offering:

\- Recommendations for suitable BINs and GEOs

\- Custom conditions

\- Limit adjustments

\- Updates on service changes

\- Consistent attention to your needs

## Fees

One of the most critical questions when issuing or topping up cards is the commission percentage that will be charged. Often, the stated fees don’t match the actual ones, and you may find yourself paying 6% instead of the promised 4%, without even realizing it. Fees are always present, but it’s often unclear where they come from: is it the service fee, the bank fee, or currency conversion charges? We recommend not relying solely on the interface data. Here are a few tips to better understand the fees:

\- Register with the service and cross-check the data you see in the interface with information provided by support or your personal manager. Sometimes the details may differ.

\- Analyze your expected expenses and compare the total fee amounts against your budget using different services. This will help you choose the most cost-effective option.

\- Test cards with small volumes across different services to understand how much you're spending on fees and whether the terms are favorable.

\- Contact support to clarify any "tiered" fee structures or special conditions for larger volumes.

Sometimes, the top-up fee can be as low as 1%, which may seem attractive at first glance. However, upon reviewing your personal account, you may discover additional fees: 5% for topping up a card, $4 for the card itself, and another $0.5 for a declined transaction. This example emphasizes the need to carefully read the payment terms.

## BINs

It’s no secret that major advertising platforms tend to prefer BINs from banks based in Europe and North America. Most services indicate the country of the issuing bank directly on their website, but we recommend not rushing to make a decision. Before selecting a BIN, you should:

1. Check the BIN using special BIN checkers. These tools allow you to see the bank's name, the issuing country, the card type, and other important characteristics.
2. Consult with the service's support team. They usually have reliable BINs that show the best performance.

If the site claims the BIN is from a European bank, but the checker shows it's from an African bank, that's a red flag. For more accuracy, use multiple checkers at once to get a clearer picture. However, even if the BIN matches the description, it doesn’t guarantee effectiveness. Advertising platforms track BIN activity, and if a BIN has frequent declines or unpaid ads, its trust level drops. Initial transactions (also known as "first billing") can reduce the trust of BINs, complicating the work for both affiliate marketers and others in the industry. Some services monitor the decline rates and trust levels of BINs, ensuring that they only offer quality options.

## Testing

Even the most trusted BIN is not a guarantee of a successful ad campaign. Proxy servers, accounts, and your anti-detect browser also play a significant role. To ensure that all components work smoothly together, testing is essential. While other tools and resources can’t directly pinpoint the perfect payment system, their influence on the final result should be considered during the testing phase. If a card is declined, it doesn't always mean the issue lies with the card itself.

## Conclusion

When choosing a payment service, you shouldn't rely solely on promotional promises or the information displayed on the homepage. This can lead to unexpected problems. Let’s summarize:

— Always communicate with the service’s representatives and support team.

— Compare the information on the website with what the support provides.

— Check BINs before using them.

— Start testing with small amounts.

— Consider the impact of other resources and tools.
