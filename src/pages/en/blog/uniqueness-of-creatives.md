**Unique creativity** is the key to Facebook advertising success. As soon as such an exclusive creative is created, we begin to use it on several accounts. Meanwhile, other webmasters can borrow the idea and use it in their own advertising campaigns. Over time, this creative loses its uniqueness, which increases the chances of being banned. To avoid this, you need to uniqueize the original creative using reliable tools such as a creative uniqueizer.



## What is uniqueness and why is it needed?

On advertising platforms, there are various methods for moderating creatives and, of course, consequences if one or another creative does not comply with the rules. For example, on Facebook these are bans and rejections, on TikTok they are rejections and shadowbans.

Most often, in arbitration, they use precisely those approaches that the site does not approve of, which means that sooner or later everyone faces bans. If the creative showed a good CTR, then it’s simply a pity to lose it. To use previously created creative, webmasters use mass uniqueness of images.

**Let's look at everything using a specific example.**

Let's imagine that I am an arbitrator who pours money on gambling on Facebook, and I test all sorts of combinations at the casino. One of the combinations converts better: more clicks, higher CR - the statistics are simply great, in general. Therefore, creativity really performs well. The image below demonstrates this creative:

The plot is quite simple: a person plays a game, spins the wheel three times in a row and doubles his winnings each time, after which he receives notifications about replenishing his bank account. All thanks to the casino.

*After a couple of days of launching the advertising campaign, they ban it.* Facebook immediately remembers that this video does not comply with the rules of the advertising platform and does not allow anyone else to use it. For Facebook, it doesn’t matter who runs the ad, so it’s useless to use different accounts, because it’s not you who’s been banned, but the creative. Therefore, the site will either immediately reject it or will not allow the ad to run for a long time. It is in such cases that uniqueness of a photo or video is needed.

**Uniqueness** is a change in the finished creative and its internal characteristics.

Any creative, be it a picture, video, animation or GIF, has its own **internal characteristics:**

* Metadata - information about the file, such as the date it was created, device, geolocation, etc.
* Hash data is a unique file ID that is automatically assigned when it is created.
* Weight - file size.
* Duration is more relevant for video and audio files.
* Resolution - the size and quality of the image or video

The creative also has **a structure** - this is how it looks (video sequence and visual elements).

*Advertising platforms analyze all the data and remember it, so if restrictions have already been imposed on a creative once, then calculating it a second time will be as easy as shelling pears.*

Uniqueness allows you to change both primary data (metadata, hash, weight, duration, resolution) and secondary data (adding various filters, noise and other visual effects).

For example the picture below:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WJeemJEm_CG1M9v-Jcwy-zRf1hoG-vHPX3W3g5V90yF-pqVMducZ3atfmys9V56q5bEknQcYFUcRLy23wc4OtrT_mWsOPmE8bLiAdvOCXoJ5_rO6iud528_fFWeg8EvIh8TvkYNXoheivw1qS1YBElw)

The first photo is the original video clip.

The second photo is a unique video creative. What we did: reduced the duration of the video by 1.5 seconds, applied filters and changed internal data (title, quality, geolocation)

## Why is uniqueness needed?

One day, almost all advertising accounts face bans from advertising platforms. In the case of working with UBT, the process is simpler, since videos can exist for a long time, but sometimes they may stop gaining views. We can say that the creative material or video is labeled “previously found to have violated the rules of the site.”

*Uniqueness allows you to change the source data so that your traffic sources will think that this is a completely new creative, even if the image itself remains almost the same.*

## Benefits of uniqueness

* Simplified moderation: new files for advertising platforms cannot be rejected at the pre-moderation stage.
* Extending the life of a creative: a unique creative undergoes moderation longer than one that is already in the Facebook database, which allows it to prolong its effectiveness.
* Increased trust: uniqueness helps to increase trust in new creatives from advertising platforms.
* Minimizing the risk of bans: unique creatives are not associated with other materials in their metadata and visual characteristics, which reduces the risk of bans.

**But even despite the advantages, uniqueness has its limitations:**

* Creative cannot be endlessly unique, and sooner or later the algorithms of advertising platforms may detect attempts to circumvent the rules. Often, advertisers are looking for a creative uniqueizer or photo uniqueization program to make the image unique online.
* Even when using online text uniqueization or other methods, there is no absolute guarantee of passing moderation.

**You can uniqueize in 2 ways:**

* Manually. Independently change the internals of the file and its appearance using editors. You can also bring in designers and editors to rearrange shots and introduce new elements into the creative.
* Automatic uniqueness using special services. We'll stop there.
