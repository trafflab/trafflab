## What is a Creative?

A creative is an advertising material designed to attract user attention and encourage them to take further action (e.g., purchase or registration). Creatives come in various formats: banners, videos, interactive elements, and more.

Creatives play a vital role in marketing strategies, helping to capture the attention of potential customers and leave a lasting impression.

## Classification of Creatives

Creatives can be classified by format and method of use:

1. Text Creatives: Contain textual messages that attract attention and generate interest in the product or service. They're often found on billboards, print media, and digital platforms.
2. Static Creatives: Graphic images or photographs that convey the key idea of the advertised product or service. These can be bright images with concise slogans or designer posters with unique compositions.
3. Dynamic Creatives: Include videos or animations that allow for more expressive and memorable information delivery.

## Recommendations for Creating Any Format of Creative

The first step is to attract attention. For this, use bright images, catchy fonts, provocative visuals - anything that can catch the eye.

The second stage involves addressing the client's problems or "pain points" to spark interest in the offer.

The third step is informing the client about the solution to their problem or the satisfaction of their needs.

Finally, conclude with a call to action.

## What to Consider Before Creating Creatives:

1. Study your target audience (TA): Consider their GEO, age, payment preferences, etc. Websites like [Trafflab.io](https://trafflab.io/ru/blog) can provide insights into various GEOs like Kazakhstan, Czech Republic, France, USA, Mexico, and many others. 
2. Study the traffic source: For instance, creatives for Facebook and TikTok should differ, even when promoting the same offer. TikTok thrives on trends, music, characters, and animations, while Facebook favors banners without music or excessive animation. Users often browse videos on mute, so subtitles are crucial. Adapt to the audience and approach of each platform.
3. Read the offer information: Besides permitted and prohibited traffic sources, there might be specific approaches to avoid.

Creatives must align with the offer, vertical, traffic source, and be understandable to the target audience.

## Where to Find Creatives:

1. Spy Tools: These tools allow you to "spy" on your competitors' ads and see what creatives they are using. This can be a great way to get ideas for your own creatives. Popular spy tools include AdPlexity, AdSpy, and Anstrex.
2. Affiliate Networks: Many affiliate networks offer free creatives to their affiliates. These creatives are usually pre-made and ready to use, but you may need to customize them to fit your specific offer and brand.
3. Freelance Marketplaces: You can find freelance designers on websites like Upwork, Fiverr, and Guru who can create custom creatives for you. This option offers more creative control, but it can also be more expensive than using pre-made creatives.
4. Online Design Tools: Several online design tools can help you create professional-looking creatives, even if you don't have any design experience. Popular options include Canva, Adobe Spark, and Snappa.
5. Social Media: Keep an eye on the creatives that your competitors and other businesses in your niche are using on social media. This can give you ideas for your creatives and help you understand what's currently working well.
6. Get inspired by other industries: Don't be afraid to look outside of the affiliate marketing industry for creative inspiration. Sometimes, the best ideas come from unexpected places.
