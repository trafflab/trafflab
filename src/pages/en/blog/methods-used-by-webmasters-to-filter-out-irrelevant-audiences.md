Some users who click on links posted by webmasters are irrelevant.

Irrelevant audiences do not bring income to webmasters, but only worsen statistics, hinder the optimization of their advertising campaigns, and waste budget. Therefore, arbitrage publishers try to do everything possible to cut off such users and prevent them from making the transition. What methods can be used to achieve this goal?

## Irrelevant users â€“ who are they?

Any user who, from the outset, did not intend to perform any targeted actions on the website or, for whatever reason, is simply unable to do so is considered irrelevant. Such user behavior can be caused by various factors, such as geo or age restrictions.

By excluding this audience, you will avoid wasting your budget and maintain the transparency of your statistics.

The most common irrelevant users include:

1. Persons who have not yet reached the age of majority. School and university students are often unable to perform targeted actions on certain Internet resources due to restrictions. This audience can be used for a limited number of verticals: information products, gaming, etc.
2. Users with insufficient funds. People with limited finances carefully study offers, often call customer support, but refuse to subscribe or place orders, and therefore do not generate profit.
3. Visitors. Migrants, who usually experience financial difficulties, rarely have disposable income to purchase services and goods. Therefore, such visitors are not profitable for either webmasters or advertisers.
4. Those who do not meet the requirements set by the advertiser. Advertisers will not pay for the targeted actions of users who do not meet the age, location, and other parameters.
5. Those who have already performed the targeted action. If a person has already performed the targeted action, there is no point in continuing to show them ads.
6. Bots. The presence of bots leads to ad clicks and poor statistics.

Visitors with high expectations often refuse to make a purchase. To prevent such situations, do not include inaccurate information in your creativity. All data posted by publishers about promotions, prices, and characteristics of the advertised products must be accurate and truthful so as not to cause disappointment among users and provoke them to abandon the conversion.

## Filter out irrelevant users with targeting

When setting up [targeting](https://affcommunity.org/en/what-should-a-webmaster-know-about-targeting/), pay special attention to the following indicators:

1. Age, gender. Must meet the requirements set by the advertiser.
2. Device. iPhone and Macbook owners are usually wealthier and more solvent than other users.
3. Time, language. These settings should match those used by the local population to exclude foreign citizens.
4. Geo. Exclude locations where the most low-income users live or where there are many migrants.
5. Interests. To exclude low-income users, exclude interests related to loans. Migrants can be excluded by removing their national interests in the settings.

In addition, you can create a retargeting database and include those who have previously visited the order page. By removing it from targeting, you will prevent ads from being shown to visitors who have converted.

## Cloaking

Using a tracker or cloaking, you can redirect irrelevant users to a white page. This will not eliminate the risk of ad click fraud, but it will ensure that your landing pages remain intact and your statistics remain transparent. To do this, you should also set filters for the offer by GEO, languages, devices, age, time, etc. Redirect bots to a 404 page.

The [top service](https://affcommunity.org/en/service/money-safe/) for creating White Pages can be found on the AffCommunity website.

## Repelling with creativity

To bypass local and some other restrictions, some irrelevant users can be disguised as a high-quality audience, as they use fake data or special anonymity programs.

To prevent them from clicking on the ad link, you can use the following methods:

* specify the price in the ad, excluding insolvent visitors;
* use adult content that is unacceptable to Muslim immigrants from Eastern countries;
* inform users about the need for verification, which is impossible for minors on trading platforms, bookmaker websites, and online casinos;
* use regional currency, dialects, flags, and other local symbols to reduce interest among foreign citizens.
* Indicate the composition of products in order to exclude people with allergies in advance.

## Conclusion

By using the above methods to exclude irrelevant audiences, you can protect your statistics from being distorted and your budget from unnecessary spending.
