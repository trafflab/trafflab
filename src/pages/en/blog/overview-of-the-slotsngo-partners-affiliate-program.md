## Terms and Rates



## How to Engage Your Audience: Creative Guidelines

To ensure a successful campaign, your creatives should be vibrant, culturally localized, and directly resonate with the target audience. Here are some tested strategies to help you attract players and convey that this platform is a gateway to success.

• Influencer marketing on YouTube and TikTok is your trump card. Create casino reviews, showcase real winnings, or film relaxed “bedside” tutorials where influencers casually explain how easy it is to start playing. This builds trust and drives engagement.

• ASO and UAC: Use local keywords like “Slots India” or “Casino INR” and include app icons with Hindi text to capture attention. Highlight financial success by showing Indian players winning and cashing out via UPI, and emphasize bonuses available through local payment methods.

• Video creatives: Produce short clips showing how easy it is to deposit and withdraw via Paytm or UPI, and highlight the sleek and intuitive casino interface.

• Don’t forget social proof: real player testimonials and visuals of INR payouts work effectively. Record success stories for YouTube to add credibility and demonstrate that the platform delivers real rewards.
